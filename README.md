# CATGNN_phonon_DOS
code used to predict phonon DOS using our developed CATGNN model which was used to produce the following work:</br>
Al-Fahdi, M., Lin, C., Shen, C., Zhang, H., & Hu, M. Rapid prediction of phonon density
of states by crystal attention graph neural network and High-Throughput screening of candidate
substrates for wide bandgap electronic cooling. *Materials Today Physics*, **2024**, 101632.

## Required Packages
the following packages are required to run the code:
<code>torch=2.5.1</code></br>
<code>torch-geometric=2.6.1</code></br>
<code>torch-scatter=2.1.2</code></br>
<code>e3nn=0.5.1</code></br>
<code>Jarvis-tools=2024.10.30</code></br>
<code>scikit-learn=1.2.2</code></br>

other versions might work, but those versions were successful in running the code

## Usage
you can simply run the following line to run the code:<br/>
<code>python main.py</code>
